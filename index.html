                <img class="headshot" src="./assets/images/headshot.jpg" alt="Photo of Kevin Harty"> I currently reside in Carlsbad, CA where I have lived for the past 7 years. When I have some free time, you'll find me spending it with my wife and 2 year-old daughter Campbell, hopefully outdoors or sneaking in a surf.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm excited about coding! 
            </p>
            <p>
                I've spent nearly 15 years in finance after getting my start on Wall Street, just before the financial crisis. Late nights (early mornings really) fumbling with outdated programs and SQL server was my trial-by-fire into the coding space. Since then, I've held a few different roles in sales focusing on management for the last 7 years. Building, training and empowering sales teams to succeed has been a very challenging and rewarding experience.
            </p>
            <p>
               My goal is to enter into the sphere of the "creative" and exit the simply "competitive" world. I still love sales, I still love managing, and I am excited to leverage my expertise and knowledge in the managerial and financial realms to that end. I'll try to keep you posted as the adventure unfolds...
